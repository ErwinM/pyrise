A Python wrapper for Highrise
----------------------------------
More just just a Python wrapper for Highrise, pyrise gives you class
objects that work a lot like Django models, making the whole experience of
integrating with Highrise just a little more awesome and Pythonic.


Installation
------------
Just clone this repository anywhere in your PythonPath like this:

    $ git clone http://github.com/feedmagnet/pyrise.git

Note that you'll also need to get httplib2 if you don't already have it.

Once you've done one of the above, you can test to see if it is installed from
the Python interactive terminal:

    >>> import pyrise

If you don't get an error, you should be good to go.
